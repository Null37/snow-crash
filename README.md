# snow-crash

Snow-Crash, a project within the 1337 (42-network), serves as your initial gateway into the realm of cybersecurity. 

The primary objective of this project is to propel participants to a higher level, wherein each level corresponds to a user in the Linux system. Through the exploration of privilege escalation, the project illuminates crucial insights into security vulnerabilities present in systems, code, and behaviors. Areas of focus include heightened awareness of security lapses, such as storing passwords with inadequate encryption, employing outdated methods like storing passwords in /etc/password, and potential binary exploitations. Additionally, Snow-Crash provides valuable lessons in enumeration, teaching participants how to effectively gather information about the target machine. In doing so, it acts as a catalyst for enhancing understanding and proficiency in comprehensive cybersecurity practices.
